# 📁 Renamer CLI

a simple Node.js CLI tool that allows you to bulk rename files in a folder based on their extension.

you can specify the directory and file extension, and the program will walk through each file and ask you to provide a new name or skip it.

tool prevents overwriting by prompting if a file with the new name already exists. additionally, it handles invalid characters in file names.
